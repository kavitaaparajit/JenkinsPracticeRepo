 To list the files:

# ls -al

drwxr-xr-x 2 root root  19 May  5 04:00 .
dr-xr-x--- 4 root root 139 May  5 03:54 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   0 May  5 04:00 file1


Here : 

d = directory
- = in the beginning indicates it is a file

. = current directory
.. = parent directory

0 = size of the file in bytes

root = user that created the file or directory

root = group name that user is part of

Rw-r--r– : permissions of the file

r = Read permissions
w = write
x = Execute permission
- = No permission

U -> file user/owner
G -> group user
o -> other users on the linux server
a -> all the users

Break down the permission in to 3 parts:
